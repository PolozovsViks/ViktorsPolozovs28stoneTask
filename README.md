Viktors Polozovs 28stone task for Automation Tester position


According to 'QA Automation Engineer - Test Task', I've used Cucumber with Java to automate following scenario:

    Login, add item to cart, check that the correct item is added

Additionally, I've created couple extra scenarios for different related cases:

    Login, add 4 items to cart, remove 3 items and check that 1 items are left
    Login, sort items by preference
    
    
Since the task is relatively small, I did all three cases in one cart.feature file and one TaskSteps.java file
